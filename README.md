# Zomato-Time-Delivery-Prediction
This project aims to predict food delivery times using machine learning, based on various real-world features such as delivery partner age, vehicle type, and distance. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost, and deployed using Flask for real-time web-based predictions.

###🚚 Delivery Time Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the estimated delivery time for food orders based on features such as delivery partner age, vehicle type, and distance. The model is trained using XGBoost and deployed via a Flask web application for real-time predictions.


### 📊 Project Overview

Timely food delivery is crucial for customer satisfaction in the food service industry. This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline that can accurately estimate delivery time by analyzing various real-world factors.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the key variables influencing delivery time using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Build and train an ML model that predicts delivery time with high accuracy.
- Deploy the model using a Flask-based web interface for real-time usage.
